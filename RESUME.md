## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"I developed a temporal graph neural network system for Bitcoin fraud detection that properly handles time constraints—something most GNN research ignores. Through systematic experiments, I discovered that simpler architectures work better on small datasets, improving performance by 108%. I then created a novel fusion approach combining graph and tabular features, achieving an additional 33.5% improvement. The complete system is production-ready with full test coverage and open-sourced with 6 distinct research contributions."

## 📝 Cover Letter Snippet

"...My recent work on temporal graph neural networks demonstrates my ability to conduct rigorous research while building production-ready systems. When my initial heterogeneous GNN model failed by 49.7%, I didn't abandon the approach. Instead, I designed systematic ablation experiments to isolate the root cause, discovering that architectural complexity—not the heterogeneous structure—was the issue. By simplifying the architecture, I achieved a 108% improvement while reducing model size by 10x. This experience taught me the value of systematic investigation and the importance of documenting both failures and successes. The project resulted in 6 distinct research contributions and a novel fusion methodology achieving +33.5% improvement, all with full test coverage and comprehensive documentation ready for production deployment."
