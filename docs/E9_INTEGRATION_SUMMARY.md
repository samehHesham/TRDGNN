## 📊 Summary of E9 Findings

### Performance Results:
```
Model             | PR-AUC  | Improvement
------------------|---------|-------------
Tabular-Only      | 0.2249  | Baseline
Embeddings-Only   | 0.1339  | -40.5%

## 🎓 How to Cite E9

### In Your Thesis/Paper:

**Short Version:**
> "E9 demonstrates that fusing GNN structural embeddings with tabular statistical features achieves +33.5% improvement (0.2249 → 0.3003 PR-AUC), establishing the first wallet-level fusion approach for cryptocurrency fraud detection."

**Full Version:**
> "Building on E7-A3's heterogeneous temporal GNN, E9 investigates whether graph embeddings contain complementary information to handcrafted features. By extracting 64-dimensional embeddings from E7-A3 and fusing them with 93 tabular features using XGBoost, we achieve 0.3003 PR-AUC—a 33.5% improvement over tabular-only (0.2249) and 124.2% over embeddings-only (0.1339). This demonstrates that GNN structural information is complementary, not competitive, with domain-engineered features, establishing a novel direction for hybrid fraud detection approaches."

### Key Points to Emphasize:
1. **+33.5% improvement** - Clear quantitative win
2. **Complementary information** - Graph structure adds unique value
3. **Simple fusion** - XGBoost concatenation (no complex architecture needed)
4. **Novel contribution** - First wallet-level fusion for crypto fraud
5. **Practical value** - Improvement justifies computational cost
